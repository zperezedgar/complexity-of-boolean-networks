abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2015. Published by Oxford University Press, on behalf of the Society of Systematic Biologists. Using genetic data to resolve the evolutionary relationships of species is of major interest in evolutionary and systematic biology. However, reconstructing the sequence of speciation events, the so-called species tree, in closely related and potentially hybridizing species is very challenging. Processes such as incomplete lineage sorting and interspecific gene flow result in local gene genealogies that differ in their topology from the species tree, and analyses of few loci with a single sequence per species are likely to produce conflicting or even misleading results. To study these phenomena on a full phylogenomic scale, we use whole-genome sequence data from 200 individuals of four black-and-white flycatcher species with so far unresolved phylogenetic relationships to infer gene tree topologies and visualize genome-wide patterns of gene tree incongruence. Using phylogenetic analysis in nonoverlapping 10-kb windows, we show that gene tree topologies are extremely diverse and change on a very small physical scale. Moreover, we find strong evidence for gene flow among flycatcher species, with distinct patterns of reduced introgression on the Z chromosome. To resolve species relationships on the background of widespread gene tree incongruence, we used four complementary coalescent-based methods for species tree reconstruction, including complex modeling approaches that incorporate post-divergence gene flow among species. This allowed us to infer the most likely species tree with high confidence. Based on this finding, we show that regions of reduced effective population size, which have been suggested as particularly useful for species tree inference, can produce positively misleading species tree topologies. Our findings disclose the pitfalls of using loci potentially under selection as phylogenetic markers and highlight the potential of modeling approaches to disentangle species relationships in systems with large effective population sizes and post-divergence gene flow.},

@article{kolmo_graph,
abstract = {One of the most popular methods of estimating the complexity of networks is to measure the entropy of network invariants, such as adjacency matrices or degree sequences. Unfortunately, entropy and all entropy-based information-theoretic measures have several vulnerabilities. These measures neither are independent of a particular representation of the network nor can capture the properties of the generative process, which produces the network. Instead, we advocate the use of the algorithmic entropy as the basis for complexity definition for networks. Algorithmic entropy (also known as Kolmogorov complexity or K -complexity for short) evaluates the complexity of the description required for a lossless recreation of the network. This measure is not affected by a particular choice of network features and it does not depend on the method of network representation. We perform experiments on Shannon entropy and K -complexity for gradually evolving networks. The results of these experiments point to K -complexity as the more robust and reliable measure of network complexity. The original contribution of the paper includes the introduction of several new entropy-deceiving networks and the empirical comparison of entropy and K -complexity as fundamental quantities for constructing complexity measures for networks.},

Using two different measures, Shannon's block entropy and Kolmogorov complexity, the latter approximated by two different methods (lossless compressibility and block decomposition), we arrive at the same trend of larger complex behavioral fractions. We also advance a notion of asymptotic and limit behavior for individual rules, both over initial conditions and runtimes, and we provide a formalization of Wolfram's classification as a limit function in terms of Kolmogorov complexity.},

abstract = {We investigate the properties of a Block Decomposition Method (BDM), which extends the power of a Coding Theorem Method (CTM) that approximates local estimations of algorithmic complexity based on Solomonoff–Levin's theory of algorithmic probability providing a closer connection to algorithmic complexity than previous attempts based on statistical regularities such as popular lossless compression schemes. The strategy behind BDM is to find small computer programs that produce the components of a larger, decomposed object. The set of short computer programs can then be artfully arranged in sequence so as to produce the original object. We show that the method provides efficient estimations of algorithmic complexity but that it performs like Shannon entropy when it loses accuracy. We estimate errors and study the behaviour of BDM for different boundary conditions, all of which are compared and assessed in detail. The measure may be adapted for use with more multi-dimensional objects than strings, objects such as arrays and tensors. To test the measure we demonstrate the power of CTM on low algorithmic-randomness objects that are assigned maximal entropy (e.g., $\pi$ ) but whose numerical approximations are closer to the theoretical low algorithmic-randomness expectation. We also test the measure on larger objects including dual, isomorphic and cospectral graphs for which we know that algorithmic randomness is low. We also release implementations of the methods in most major programming languages—Wolfram Language (Mathematica), Matlab, R, Perl, Python, Pascal, C++, and Haskell—and an online algorithmic complexity calculator.},

abstract = {This paper describes an approach to detecting distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that is based on fundamentals of information theory, specifically Kolmogorov complexity. The algorithm is based on a concept of Kolmogorov complexity that states that the joint complexity measure of random strings is lower than the sum of the complexities of the individual strings if the strings exhibit some correlation. Furthermore, the joint complexity measure varies inversely with the amount of correlation. The proposed algorithm exploits this feature to correlate traffic flows in the network and detect possible denial-of-service attacks. One of the strengths of this algorithm is that it does not require special filtering rules and hence it can be used to detect any type of DDoS attack. This algorithm is shown to perform better than simple packet-counting or load-measuring approaches.},

@article{clustering,
abstract = {We present a new method for clustering based on compression. The method doesn't use subject-specific features or background knowledge, and works as follows: First, we determine a universal similarity distance, the normalized compression distance or NCD, computed from the lengths of compressed data files (singly and in pairwise concatenation). Second, we apply a hierarchical clustering method. The NCD is universal in that it is not restricted to a specific application area, and works across application area boundaries. A theoretical precursor, the normalized information distance, co-developed by one of the authors, is provably optimal but uses the non-computable notion of Kolmogorov complexity. We propose precise notions of similarity metric, normal compressor, and show that the NCD based on a normal compressor is a similarity metric that approximates universality. To extract a hierarchy of clusters from the distance matrix, we determine a dendrogram (binary tree) by a new quartet method and a fast heuristic to implement it. The method is implemented and available as public software, and is robust under choice of different compressors. To substantiate our claims of universality and robustness, we report evidence of successful application in areas as diverse as genomics, virology, languages, literature, music, handwritten digits, astronomy, and combinations of objects from completely different domains, using statistical, dictionary, and block sorting compressors. In genomics we presented new evidence for major questions in Mammalian evolution, based on whole-mitochondrial genomic analysis: the Eutherian orders and the Marsupionta hypothesis against the Theria hypothesis.},

abstract = {We propose a measure based upon the fundamental theoretical concept in algorithmic information theory that provides a natural approach to the problem of evaluating n -dimensional complexity by using an n -dimensional deterministic Turing machine. The technique is interesting because it provides a natural algorithmic process for symmetry breaking generating complex n -dimensional structures from perfectly symmetric and fully deterministic computational rules producing a distribution of patterns as described by algorithmic probability. Algorithmic probability also elegantly connects the frequency of occurrence of a pattern with its algorithmic complexity, hence effectively providing estimations to the complexity of the generated patterns. Experiments to validate estimations of algorithmic complexity based on these concepts are presented, showing that the measure is stable in the face of some changes in computational formalism and that results are in agreement with the results obtained using lossless compression algorithms when both methods overlap in their range of applicability. We then use the output frequency of the set of 2-dimensional Turing machines to classify the algorithmic complexity of the space-time evolutions of Elementary Cellular Automata.},

abstract = {Using frequency distributions of daily closing price time series of several financial market indices, we investigate whether the bias away from an equiprobable sequence distribution found in the data, predicted by algorithmic information theory, may account for some of the deviation of financial markets from log‐normal, and if so for how much of said deviation and over what sequence lengths. We do so by comparing the distributions of binary sequences from actual time series of financial markets and series built up from purely algorithmic means. Our discussion is a starting point for a further investigation of the market as a rule‐based system with an algorithmic component, despite its apparent randomness, and the use of the theory of algorithmic probability with new tools that can be applied to the study of the market price phenomenon. The main discussion is cast in terms of assumptions common to areas of economics in agreement with an algorithmic view of the market.},

The hypothesis that contemporary organisms are also randomly constructed molecular automata is examined by modeling the gene as a binary (on-off) device and studying the behavior of large, randomly constructed nets of these binary “genes”. The results suggest that, if each “gene” is directly affected by two or three other “genes”, then such random nets: behave with great order and stability; undergo behavior cycles whose length predicts cell replication time as a function of the number of genes per cell; possess different modes of behavior whose number per net predicts roughly the number of cell types in an organism as a function of its number of genes; and under the stimulus of noise are capable of differentiating directly from any mode of behavior to at most a few other modes of behavior. Cellular differentation is modeled as a Markov chain among the modes of behavior of a genetic net. The possibility of a general theory of metabolic behavior is suggested."

@article{rbn_aldana,
abstract = {The dynamics of Boolean networks with scale-free topology are studied. The existence of a phase transition from ordered to chaotic dynamics, governed by the value of the scale-free exponent of the network, is shown analytically by analyzing the overlap between two distinct trajectories. The phase diagram shows that the phase transition occurs for values of the scale-free exponent in the open interval (2, 2.5). Since the Boolean networks under study are directed graphs, the scale-free topology of the input connections and that of the output connections are studied separately. Ultimately these two topologies are shown to be equivalent. A numerical study of the attractor structure of the configuration space reveals that this structure is similar in both networks with scale-free topologies and networks with homogeneous random topologies. However, an important result of this work is that the fine-tuning usually required to achieve stability in the dynamics of networks with homogeneous random topologies is no longer necessary when the network topology is scale-free. Finally, based on the results presented in this work, it is hypothesized that the scale-free topology favors the evolution and adaptation of network functioning from a biological perspective. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A Kauffman network is an abstract model of gene regulatory networks. Each gene is represented by a vertex. An edge from one vertex to another implies that the former gene regulates the latter. Statistical features of Kauffman networks match the characteristics of living cells. The number of cycles in the network's state space, called attractors, corresponds to the number of different cell types. The attractor's length corresponds to the cell cycle time. The sensitivity of attractors to different kinds of disturbances, modeled by changing a network connection, the state of a vertex, or the associated function, reflects the stability of the cell to damage, mutations and virus attacks. In order to evaluate attractors, their number and lengths have to be computed. This problem is the major open problem related to Kauffman networks. Available algorithms can only handle networks with less than a hundred vertices. The number of genes in a cell is often larger. In this paper, we present a set of efficient algorithms for computing attractors in large Kauffman networks. The resulting software package is hoped to be of assistance in understanding the principles of gene interactions and discovering a computing scheme operating on these principles.},

The biological stationary state, the G1 state, is a global attractor of the dynamics. The biological pathway, the cell-cycle sequence of protein states, is a globally attracting trajectory of the dynamics. These properties are largely preserved with respect to small perturbations to the network. These results suggest that cellular regulatory networks are robustly designed for their functions.},

For instance, the dataset can be obtained from the diagnosis of describing the diffusion process of cancer cells. With the observed datasets, several methods to construct the dynamic models for such Boolean networks are proposed. Instead of building the logical dynamics of a Boolean network directly, its algebraic form is constructed first and then is converted back to the logical form. Firstly, a general construction technique is proposed. To reduce the size of required data, the model with the known network graph is considered. Motivated by this, the least in-degree model is constructed that can reduce the size of required data set tremendously. Next, the uniform network is investigated. The number of required data points for identification of such networks is independent of the size of the network. Finally, some principles are proposed for dealing with data with errors.},

This tutorial provides an introduction to the essential concepts of these two Boolean models, and presents the up-to-date analysis and simulation methods developed for them. In the Analysis section, we will show that Boolean models are Markov chains, based on which we present a Markovian steady-state analysis on attractors, and also reveal the relationship between probabilistic Boolean networks and dynamic Bayesian networks (another popular genetic network model), again via Markov analysis; we dedicate the last subsection to structural analysis, which opens a door to other topics such as network control. The Simulation section will start from the basic tasks of creating state transition diagrams and finding attractors, proceed to the simulation of network dynamics and obtaining the steady-state distributions, and finally come to an algorithm of generating artificial Boolean networks with prescribed attractors. The contents are arranged in a roughly logical order, such that the Markov chain analysis lays the basis for the most part of Analysis section, and also prepares the readers to the topics in Simulation section.},

@article{cancer_rbn,
abstract = {A Boolean dynamical system integrating the main signaling pathways involved in cancer is constructed based on the currently known protein-protein interaction network. This system exhibits stationary protein activation patterns - attractors - dependent on the cell's microenvironment. These dynamical attractors were determined through simulations and their stabilities against mutations were tested. In a higher hierarchical level, it was possible to group the network attractors into distinct cell phenotypes and determine driver mutations that promote phenotypic transitions. We find that driver nodes are not necessarily central in the network topology, but at least they are direct regulators of central components towards which converge or through which crosstalk distinct cancer signaling pathways. The predicted drivers are in agreement with those pointed out by diverse census of cancer genes recently performed for several human cancers. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that cell phenotypes can evolve towards full malignancy through distinct sequences of accumulated mutations. In particular, the network model supports routes of carcinogenesis known for some tumor types. Finally, the Boolean network model is employed to evaluate the outcome of molecularly targeted cancer therapies. The major find is that monotherapies were additive in their effects and that the association of targeted drugs is necessary for cancer eradication. {\textcopyright} 2013 Fumi{\~{a}}, Martins.},

abstract = "Expression of the Drosophila segment polarity genes is initiated by a pre-pattern of pair-rule gene products and maintained by a network of regulatory interactions throughout several stages of embryonic development. Analysis of a model of gene interactions based on differential equations showed that wild-type expression patterns of these genes can be obtained for a wide range of kinetic parameters, which suggests that the steady states are determined by the topology of the network and the type of regulatory interactions between components, not the detailed form of the rate laws. To investigate this, we propose and analyse a Boolean model of this network which is based on a binary ON/OFF representation of mRNA and protein levels, and in which the interactions are formulated as logical functions. In this model the spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression are determined by the topology of the network and whether components are present or absent, rather than the absolute levels of the mRNAs and proteins and the functional details of their interactions. The model is able to reproduce the wild-type gene expression patterns, as well as the ectopic expression patterns observed in overexpression experiments and various mutants. Furthermore, we compute explicitly all steady states of the network and identify the basin of attraction of each steady state. The model gives important insights into the functioning of the segment polarity gene network, such as the crucial role of the wingless and sloppy paired genes, and the network's ability to correct errors in the pre-pattern."

abstract = {Random Boolean networks (RBNs) are models of genetic regulatory networks. It is useful to describe RBNs as self-organizing systems to study how changes in the nodes and connections affect the global network dynamics. This article reviews eight different methods for guiding the self-organization of RBNs. In particular, the article is focussed on guiding RBNs towards the critical dynamical regime, which is near the phase transition between the ordered and dynamical phases. The properties and advantages of the critical regime for life, computation, adaptability, evolvability, and robustness are reviewed. The guidance methods of RBNs can be used for engineering systems with the features of the critical regime, as well as for studying how natural selection evolved living systems, which are also critical.},

abstract = {This paper describes an interactive multi-track MIDI sequencer for generating polyrhythmic patterns. Patterns are determined by the state of a set of autonomous Boolean networks, each node of which corresponds to a single musical event. This event will be triggered if the Boolean node is active and the sequencer step corresponds to its location in the pattern. Users may alter the networks which generate the patterns and change the note information they trigger whilst a sequence plays. Thus the sequencer may be used in live performance or in a studio. Additionally the sequencer may be left to generate its own patterns based on the behaviour of the Boolean networks.},

@article{prospects_rbn,
abstract = {Computer models are valuable tools towards an understanding of the cell's biochemical regulatory machinery. Possible levels of description of such models range from modelling the underlying biochemical details to top-down approaches, using tools from the theory of complex networks. The latter, coarse-grained approach is taken where regulatory circuits are classified in graph-theoretical terms, with the elements of the regulatory networks being reduced to simply nodes and links, in order to obtain architectural information about the network. Further, considering dynamics on networks at such an abstract level seems rather unlikely to match dynamical regulatory activity of biological cells. Therefore, it came as a surprise when recently examples of discrete dynamical network models based on very simplistic dynamical elements emerged which in fact do match sequences of regulatory patterns of their biological counterparts. Here I will review such discrete dynamical network models, or Boolean networks, of biological regulatory networks. Further, we will take a look at such models extended with stochastic noise, which allow studying the role of network topology in providing robustness against noise. In the end, we will discuss the interesting question of why at all such simple models can describe aspects of biology despite their simplicity. Finally, prospects of Boolean models in exploratory dynamical models for biological circuits and their mutants will be discussed.},

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},
